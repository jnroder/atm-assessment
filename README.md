Stack: React + TypeScript + Vite + Express

## How to run

1. Install dependencies:
```npm install```

2. Start Vite client server:
```npm run dev```

3. In another terminal instance, start the NodeJS/Express backend server:
```node server/index.js```

Once those are running, you should be able to visit the webapp here: http://localhost:5173/

## Testing

Data is stored in `~/server/data.json`. You can use the PINs given there.

That's it! I was testing in Chrome.
